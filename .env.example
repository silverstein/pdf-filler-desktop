# PDF Filler Desktop Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and adjust as needed

# Server port (default: 3456)
# Only needed if you want to change the default port
PORT=3456

# Google Cloud Project ID
# This is ONLY for Google Workspace/G Suite accounts
# Regular Gmail accounts do NOT need this at all
# 
# If you have a Workspace account, the app already sets a default dummy value
# ('pdf-filler-desktop') that makes authentication work. You don't need to change it!
# The authentication just needs SOME value to be present, it doesn't matter what it is.
#
# Leave this commented out unless you have a specific reason to change it:
# GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=pdf-filler-desktop

# Rate Limiting (these are NOT currently used by the app)
# The app uses hardcoded limits of 50 req/min and 900 req/day
# These may be implemented in future versions
# MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=50
# MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY=900

# File Upload Limits (NOT currently used by the app)
# The app uses multer's default limits
# This may be implemented in future versions
# MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=50

# Note: For most users, you don't need a .env file at all!
# The app works with all defaults for regular Gmail accounts.
