# CLAUDE.md - PDF Filler

## Project Overview
PDF Filler is a desktop application that provides **completely free** PDF processing using Google's Gemini CLI free tier. Users authenticate with their Google account (OAuth) and get access to AI-powered PDF analysis, form filling, and data extraction - all without API keys or costs.

## Core Concept
- **NO API keys required** - Uses OAuth authentication only
- **NO costs** - Leverages Gemini's generous free tier (60 req/min, 1000 req/day, 1M token context)
- **Local Gemini CLI instance** - Each user gets their own isolated Gemini installation
- **Direct file access** - Gemini CLI reads PDFs directly from the filesystem

## Architecture

### Key Components
1. **Electron Desktop App** (`src/electron.js`)
   - System tray integration
   - Local server management
   - OAuth flow handling

2. **Express Server** (`src/server.js`)
   - PDF upload/processing endpoints
   - Runs on localhost:3456

3. **Gemini Simple Bridge** (`src/gemini-simple.js`)
   - Passes file paths directly to Gemini CLI
   - Handles rate limiting
   - Cleans output (removes "Loaded cached credentials" etc.)

4. **Auth Handler** (`src/simple-auth-handler.js`)
   - Opens Terminal for first-time auth
   - Monitors for auth completion
   - Manages local credentials

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. App opens Terminal with local Gemini CLI
3. User completes OAuth in browser
4. Credentials saved to `gemini-cli-local/.gemini/`
5. App detects auth completion and switches to main UI

### PDF Processing
1. User uploads PDF to `uploads/` directory
2. App passes file path to Gemini: `"Analyze the PDF at: uploads/filename.pdf"`
3. Gemini CLI reads file directly and returns JSON response
4. App parses response and displays results

## Important Notes

### Local Gemini Instance
- Installed at `gemini-cli-local/`
- Uses `HOME` environment variable override to isolate config
- Each user's credentials stay on their machine only

### Rate Limiting
- 50 requests/minute (with buffer from 60 limit)
- 900 requests/day (with buffer from 1000 limit)
- 2-minute timeout for long operations

### Known Issues & Solutions
1. **"Loaded cached credentials" in output**: Already filtered in `gemini-simple.js`
2. **Long processing times**: Increased timeout to 2 minutes, added visual timer
3. **Workspace accounts**: Require `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` env var (set to dummy value)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start app (Electron + server)
npm start

# Run server only (for testing)
npm run server

# Run setup wizard
npm run setup

# Test local Gemini CLI
HOME=./gemini-cli-local ./gemini-cli-local/node_modules/.bin/gemini -p "test"

# Build standalone app for distribution
npm run build
```

## Building the Electron App

### IMPORTANT: Build Configuration
The `package.json` build configuration MUST include all necessary files:

```json
"build": {
  "files": [
    "src/**/*",           // All source code
    "public/**/*",        // Web UI files
    "gemini-cli-local/**/*", // CRITICAL: Local Gemini installation
    "assets/**/*",        // Icons and resources
    "scripts/**/*",       // Setup scripts
    "uploads/.gitkeep",   // Upload directory structure
    "package.json",       // Package metadata
    "CLAUDE.md",         // Documentation
    "README.md"          // User documentation
  ]
}
```

### Common Build Issues
1. **"Gemini CLI Not Found" in built app**: The `gemini-cli-local` folder wasn't included in the build. Check the `files` array in package.json.
2. **No tray icon on macOS**: The app uses text "ðŸ“„ PDF" instead of an icon. This is intentional since no icon file exists.
3. **Window doesn't open**: Usually means the server failed to start. Check Console.app for error logs.

## File Structure
```
gemini-pdf-filler/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ electron.js         # Main Electron process
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js           # Express API server
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gemini-simple.js    # Gemini CLI interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ simple-auth-handler.js # OAuth flow handler
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ preload.js          # Electron preload script
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html          # Web UI

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .gemini/           # User credentials (git-ignored)
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/               # Temporary PDF storage
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Test with Fresh Auth
```bash
rm -rf gemini-cli-local/.gemini/oauth_creds.json
rm -rf gemini-cli-local/.gemini/google_accounts.json
npm start
```

### Test with Different Account Types
- Personal Gmail: Works perfectly
- Workspace account: Needs `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` env var
- Code Assist account: Use personal Gmail instead

### Test PDF Operations via the App
The app uses Express server endpoints, NOT direct Gemini CLI calls. Always test through the server:

```bash
# Test extraction endpoint (this is what the app uses):
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/api/extract \
  -F "pdf=@uploads/your-pdf-file.pdf" \
  | python3 -m json.tool

# Test other endpoints:
curl http://localhost:3456/api/health     # Check system status
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/api/analyze -F "pdf=@uploads/file.pdf"   # Analyze PDF structure
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/api/validate -F "pdf=@uploads/file.pdf"  # Validate form
```

### Direct Gemini CLI Testing (for debugging only)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Must run from project root directory!
cd /Users/silverbook/Sites/gemini-pdf-filler

# Test with Flash model:
HOME=./gemini-cli-local ./gemini-cli-local/node_modules/.bin/gemini \
  -m gemini-2.5-flash \
  -p 'Look at the PDF at: uploads/test.pdf. Tell me what information you see. Format as JSON.'

# Test with Pro model (when quota available):
HOME=./gemini-cli-local ./gemini-cli-local/node_modules/.bin/gemini \
  -m gemini-2.5-pro \
  -p 'Extract all data from the PDF at: uploads/test.pdf. Return as JSON.'
```

## CRITICAL: How PDF Processing Actually Works

### The Architecture
1. **User uploads PDF** â†’ Express server (`/api/extract`)
2. **Server calls** â†’ `gemini.extractPDFData()` in `gemini-simple.js`
3. **Gemini Simple** â†’ Spawns Gemini CLI process with file path
4. **Gemini CLI** â†’ Reads PDF directly from filesystem
5. **Response** â†’ JSON parsed and returned to user

### Key Insights
- **Direct file access**: Gemini CLI can read PDFs directly when given the path!
- **No extraction needed**: Don't extract text or encode base64 - just pass the path
- **Relative paths**: Use paths relative to project root (e.g., `uploads/file.pdf`)
- **Singleton instance**: One `GeminiSimple` instance handles all requests

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Flash Model Refuses to Process PDFs
Flash sometimes says "I cannot directly read PDFs". The app handles this with:
1. Retry logic with different prompt phrasings (up to 3 attempts)
2. Simpler language: "Look at" instead of "Extract from"
3. Multiple prompt variations in `singleExtraction` method

#### Rate Limiting / Quota Issues
- **Pro model**: 60 req/min, 1000/day (but shared with other Google services)
- **Flash model**: Higher limits, used as automatic fallback
- **Automatic switching**: When Pro quota exhausted, `useFlashFallback` = true
- **Current state**: Forced to Flash due to Pro quota limits

#### Accuracy Considerations
- **Flash model**: ~95% accuracy on form extraction
- **Pro model**: ~98% accuracy (when available)
- **Consensus approach**: Tested but didn't improve accuracy, just added latency
- **Current approach**: Single extraction for speed

#### Python Boolean Issue
Gemini sometimes returns Python-style booleans (`True`/`False`). Fixed in `singleExtraction`:
```javascript
const jsonString = jsonMatch[0]
  .replace(/\bTrue\b/g, 'true')
  .replace(/\bFalse\b/g, 'false')
  .replace(/\bNone\b/g, 'null');
```

## Security Considerations
- Never commit `gemini-cli-local/.gemini/` (contains user credentials)
- PDFs in `uploads/` should be cleaned periodically
- Each user's auth is isolated to their machine
- No data sent to external servers (except Gemini AI calls)

## Future Vision
This proves that AI-powered tools can be completely free for end users. The same approach could work for:
- Document summarization
- Contract analysis  
- Receipt/invoice processing
- Any document-based AI task

The key insight: **Gemini CLI can read files directly when given the path** - no need for complex extraction or base64 encoding!
