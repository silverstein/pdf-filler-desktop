KEY OBSERVATIONS
----------------
1. The app appears to call multiple endpoints automatically:
   - /api/intelligence-local for AI insights
   - /api/extract-local for data extraction

2. Different providers were used:
   - Intelligence endpoint used Codex (despite ChatGPT being selected in UI)
   - Extract endpoint used Claude (automatic fallback?)

3. Claude output format issue:
   - Claude returns wrapped format: {"type":"result","subtype":"success",...}
   - This is Claude CLI's wrapper, not the raw extraction data
   - The actual extraction data is likely in a "content" field

4. Both operations completed successfully:
   - No errors in console
   - Both returned data
   - But UI didn't display results

LIKELY ISSUE
------------
The Claude CLI service needs to parse the wrapped output format and extract the actual content.
The output shows Claude's metadata wrapper instead of just the extraction results.

The server code expects pure JSON extraction data but receives:
{
  "type": "result",
  "subtype": "success",
  "is_error": false,
  "duration_ms": 18209,
  "content": "... actual extraction data here ..."
}

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
Update claude-cli.service.ts to parse this wrapper format and return only the content field.
